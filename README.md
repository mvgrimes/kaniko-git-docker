A docker image to run the
[kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) tool which also
contains git.

This should be similar to the official [image](gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor).

Built from the official kaniko
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/blob/master/deploy/Dockerfile).
